## GitHub Pages for Casal2 User and Developer Support

Casal2 is NIWA’s open-source integrated assessment tool for modelling the population dynamics of marine species, including ﬁshery stock assessments. Casal2 expands functionality and increases maintainability relative to its predecessor, CASAL. Casal2 can be used for quantitative assessments of marine populations, including ﬁsh, invertebrates, marine mammals and seabirds.

## About Casal2

The Casal2 software implements a generalised age-structured population model that allows for a great deal of choice in specifying the population dynamics, parameter estimation, and model outputs. Casal2 is designed for ﬂexibility. It can implement an age-structured model for a single population or multiple populations using user-deﬁned categories such as area, sex, and maturity. These structural elements are generic and not predeﬁned, and are easily constructed. Casal2 models can be used for a single population with a single anthropogenic event (in a ﬁsh population model this would be a single ﬁshery), or for multiple species and populations, areas, and/or anthropogenic or exploitation methods, and including predator-prey interactions.

In Casal2 the processes in a time period and within an annual cycle are deﬁned by the user. Observation data used for model ﬁtting can be from many different sources, like, removals-at-size or -age from an anthropogenic or exploitation event (e.g., ﬁshery or other human impact), research survey and other biomass indices, and mark-recapture data. Model parameters can be estimated using penalised maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods.

As well as the point estimates of the parameters, Casal2 can calculate the likelihood or posterior distribution proﬁles, and can generate Bayesian posterior distributions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Casal2 can project population status using deterministic or stochastic population dynamics. Casal2 can also simulate observations from a set of given model structures.
