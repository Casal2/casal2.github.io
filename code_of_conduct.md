## The Casal2 Code of Conduct

The Casal2 Code of Conduct is based on the [Open Source Contributor Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct)

## In summary:

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, educational background, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
- Please be professional, kind, and courteous.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom one right answer.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, experiment locally and see how it works.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean, or harass anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. In particular, we do not tolerate behaviour that excludes people in socially marginalised groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by another contributor, please contact the Project Manager or Project Lead immediately. 
- Whether you are a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you, a place that is civil, and free from harassment and discrimination.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.
