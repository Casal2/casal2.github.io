# About Casal2

The Casal2 software implements a generalised age-structured population model that allows for a great deal of choice in specifying the population dynamics, parameter estimation, and model outputs. Casal2 is designed for flexibility. It can implement an age-structured model for a single population or multiple populations using user-designed categories such as area, sex, and maturity. These structural elements are generic and not predefined, and are easily constructed. Casal2 models can be used for a single population with a single anthropogenic event (in a fish population model this would be a single fishery), or for multiple species and populations, areas, and/or anthropogenic or exploitation methods, and including predator-prey interactions.

In Casal2 the processes in a time period and within an annual cycle are de?ned by the user. Observation data used for model fitting can be from many different sources, like, removals-at-size or -age from an anthropogenic or exploitation event (e.g., fishery or other human impact), research survey and other biomass indices, and mark-recapture data. Model parameters can be estimated using penalised maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods.

As well as the point estimates of the parameters, Casal2 can calculate the likelihood or posterior distribution pro?les, and can generate Bayesian posterior distributions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Casal2 can project population status using deterministic or stochastic population dynamics. Casal2 can also simulate observations from a set of given model structures.
